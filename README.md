I used is here is sample NodeJs existing application and deployed it using AWS Codepipeline, Beanstalk 

Create a highly available and fault tolerant architecture for your NodeJS applications with a few simple clicks using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Build a bulletproof Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using AWS CodePipeline. Integrate building and testing processes in your CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodeBuild.
